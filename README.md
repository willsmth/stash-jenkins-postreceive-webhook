# Stash Webhook for Jenkins


After making commits to Stash, notify Jenkins that a new build has been created.

## Requirements

+  **Git Plugin** - Jenkins needs to have the [Git Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin) installed in Jenkins and the Poll SCM option must be enabled

## Setup

Once installed, follow these steps:
-  Navigate to a repository in Stash.
-  Hit the *Settings* link
-  In the left-navigation, hit the *Hooks* link
-  For the **Stash Webhook to Jenkins**, click the *Enable* button.
-  Enter the URL to your Jenkins instance
-  Select the method that clone method that Jenkins is using (HTTP or SSH).
-  If using HTTP, enter the username that Jenkins is using to clone your repository.
-  Submit the form.
-  Commit some code and watch it trigger a build!

## Troubleshooting

- Check your log file for any exceptions
- Be sure you have polling turned on for your project in Jenkins (can use **H 0 1 1 0** as an example)
- Verify that the URLs for your repository match in Jenkins and the webhook settings.  They MUST be identical.
- Still stuck? Check out the [this wiki page](https://github.com/Nerdwin15/stash-jenkins-postreceive-webhook/wiki/Debug) or open an issue
